# PYGAMES

Welcome to the **PYGAMES** repository! This project contains multiple Python-based games.

## Games Included

### 1. Hangman Game
A simple word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. Incorrect guesses increase the mistake count, and the game ends when the player either finds the word or reaches the maximum allowed mistakes.

**How to Play:**
- The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Players input letter guesses.
- Correct guesses reveal the letters in the word.
- Incorrect guesses increase the error count.
- The game ends when the word is guessed or the maximum mistakes are reached.

Run the game with:
```sh
python hangman.py
```

### 2. More Games Coming Soon!
Stay tuned for additional games like Quiz, Tic-Tac-Toe, and more!
